## The repo includes code for a university project which covers:
- MCU code that includes PID controller algorithm which set appropriate voltage on electronic components in order to reach target temperature on heating resistor,
- Web app that displays appropriate charts for the temperatures registered during heating sessions. Moreover, thanks to this app we can set target temperature for the PID controller handled by mcu.
